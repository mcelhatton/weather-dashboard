# Colin's Weather Dashboard

## Description

This program allows the user to enter a city and have its current weather and 5 day forecast weather shown.  The application will show the current temp, wind speed, humidity and UV index.  The program will color code the UV index so the user can visually see if the index is low, moderate, high and very high.  The program will also save historical city searches so the user can quickly load previous cities weather.

## Technologies Used

## Usage
